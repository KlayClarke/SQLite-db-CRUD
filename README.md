# SQLite-db-CRUD

An experiment with SQLite and SQLAlchemy to understand databases, as well as CRUD web applications. 

I created a virtual library that allows users to upload the title and author of books, as well as their rating for said entries. 

If the user decides to change their rating, they can do so with the simple push of our 'Edit' button (located beside each entry).
If the user decides to delete their entry completely, fear not - there is a trusty 'Delete' button that will handle the heavy lifting. Please BEWARE, for this button may be on a power trip.
